// This is a slightly less dirty hack to control the issues
// introduced by having a JSITransparentPod in your world.

// In the particular case where the user is controlling a vessel where the root pod is not
// a transparent pod, but a transparent pod is within physics range,
// the IVA of the non-transparent pod will be visible while the user is out of it.
// And it won't be in the correct position either.

// Which is why the JSINonTransparentPod module needs to be added
// to every non-transparent pod with IVA with ModuleManager, to hide it's IVA in
// the case that happens.
