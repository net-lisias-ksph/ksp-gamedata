EveSrfLandedIslands = The lakes have an impact on these readings.
id = atmosphereAnalysis
BopSrfLandedWesternDepression =  Amazingly, some trace elements are detected.  Someone's getting a grant to study this.
BopSrfLandedMinorDepressions = The sensor flickers indecicively for a second, then declares there is nothing to see here.
BopSrfLandedRidges = Bop is far to small to have any detectable atmosphere.
BopSrfLandedPoles = There isn't even any ice to sublimate here.  No readings.
BopSrfLandedMidlands = The sensors seem to detect something organic.  Surely it couldn't have originated here on Bop.
DresSrfLandedDresTrench = Tiny amounts of a few trace elements are detected, but then dissipate.
DunaSrfLandedMidlands = The analysis confirms that Duna's atmosphere is tenuous, but mostly composed of carbon dioxide. 
DunaSrfLandedNorthPole = The instrument detects an unexpectedly large amount of water vapor.
DunaSrfLandedSouthPole = Although still thin, the atmosphere here at the south pole is a little nicer than elsewhere.
DunaSrfLandedKerinerValley = The denser atmosphere here yeields an unexpected variety of trace elements.
DunaSrfLandedMaria = The results come back: exactly as expected.  You strongly considering going somewhere else.
DunaSrfLandedDepressions = The depressions revail traces of methane.  Could this be evidence of microbial life?
DunaSrfLandedMountains = The analysis of the mountain air confirms what the barometer told you: There isn't much of it up here.
DunaSrfLandedVallesJebbedius = The technicians are pretty sure you messed this test up.  The results are far too diverse for Duna.
EelooSrfLandedPoles = When exposed to the sun's weak rays, there does appear to be some sublimation occuring.
EelooSrfLandedScarring = There are some free elements about, but not really enough to consider it an atmosphere.
EelooSrfLandedCentralCrater = The equipment cannot detect any atmosphere here.
EelooSrfLandedAncientDepressions = No traces of an atmosphere are found here.
EelooSrfLandedPromontories = You must run the equipment through an extensive warming process before it will function here.
EelooSrfLandedLowlands = These readings indicate that the ice is not composed of water.
EveSrfLandedCraterLake = You detect some anomolous readings here near the crater.
EveSrfSplashedCraterLake = The instrument is swamped by evaporation from the surrounding lake.
EveSrfLandedEasternSea = The instrument is swamped by evaporation from the surrounding sea.
EveSrfSplashedEasternSea = The instrument is swamped by evaporation from the surrounding sea.
EveSrfLandedSouthernSea = The instrument is swamped by evaporation from the surrounding sea.
EveSrfSplashedSouthernSea = The instrument is swamped by evaporation from the surrounding sea.
EveSrfLandedLakes = The instrument is swamped by evaporation from the surrounding lake.
EveSrfSplashedLakes = The instrument is swamped by evaporation from the surrounding lake.
EveSrfLandedMountains = There is still pleanty of atmosphere at this altitude for a complex readout.
EveSrfLandedPoles = The instrument provides a detailed analysis of Eve's atmosphere.
EveSrfLandedImpactSites = There are a few trace elements which appear not to be native to Eve.
EveSrfLandedPlains = The instrument provides a detailed analysis of Eve's atmosphere.
EveSrfLandedIslands =The instrument is swamped by evaporation from the surrounding lake.
