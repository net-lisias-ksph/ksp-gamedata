title = PB-ION Electric Propulsion System
manufacturer = Ionic Symphonic Protonic Electronics
description = By emitting ionized xenon gas through a small thruster port, the PB-ION can produce incredibly efficient propulsion, but with a downside of very low thrust and high energy usage. According to ISP Electronics sales reps, the rumours of this engine being powered by "dark magic" are largely exaggerated.
