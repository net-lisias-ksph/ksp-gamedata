description = The Stayputnik offers the ultimate solution in crew safety. A lightweight sphere equipped with remote receivers and tiny gyros for orientation, it carries no crew at all, thus keeping them perfectly safe from all harm. This device does require electricity to operate however, and will cease to function if the power runs out. The built-in batteries should keep it going for about 10 minutes.
