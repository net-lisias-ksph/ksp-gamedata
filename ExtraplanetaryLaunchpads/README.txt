Extraplanetary-Launchpads
=========================

This requires Kethane 0.6 for ore mining.

Installation:
Copy the contents of the GameData folder into KSP's GameData folder.

Optionally, install Kethane mod 0.6 or greater. If You do not, the only way to build offworld would be to ship RocketPart resources up to your construction facility.

Usage:
To build a craft, you need the RocketParts resource plus any Fuel etc the craft contains.
Partial fuel fills are allowed.

RocketParts, Metal and Ore containers are included, courtesy of Grey's HexCans.
