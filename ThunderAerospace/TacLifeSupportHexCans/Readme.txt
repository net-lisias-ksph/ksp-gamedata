HexCans: Standardized Resource Canisters created by Greys.


License

This set of parts are released under CC-BY 3.0, you are free to use, alter, or add to as you desire, you may release your works using HexCans under whatever license you desire though I suggest open source as it's good for the community. You may distribute your works however you like.

Rules of Attribution

To make it simple and concrete I require only one thing to consider your released works sufficiently attributing me.

In the .cfg files for all HexCans parts there is the line
Code:

author = Greys

"Greys" must remain in that field, you of course can add your own name/names and I do not care about the order.

example:
Code:

author = BobDole & Greys

Nothing else is required for the license to be satisfied.

If you can I would like to have a link to either of the HexCans forum threads in your release thread, it does not need to be prominent, and that is not required.

Distribution

You are free to include as much of the base HexCans set alongside your add-on as you like with two conditions:

1. Do not distribute the original part set without modification.
If you'd like to make modified variants of the stock parts that is fine, either as part of a greater add-on or a derivative HexCans set, but do not distribute the original parts as is. This is to prevent unnecessary confusion from the users and

prevent the circulation of outdated assets.

2. Try to include only the assets that you need for your add-on
Limiting the HexCan assets that are distributed alongside your add-on to those that are necessary has three main benefits:
It reduces your distribution size which means players have to download less
It eliminates unused assets which KSP will still load, reducing player's memory load if they don't choose to install the main set (marginally)
It helps to prevent conflicts with the main set if assets have changed between your version and mine.


Thanks for your time!
