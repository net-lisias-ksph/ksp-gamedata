	description = A life support recycling module that uses the Sabatier reaction to recycle oxygen from carbon dioxide. It requires water as an additional input. Packaged in a larger structure for easier use with massive rockets, with the added advantage of a slightly faster conversion rate. Rated for up to 9 Kerbals.
