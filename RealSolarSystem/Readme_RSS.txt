Real Solar System
This mod will convert the Kerbol System into the Solar System, rescaling, moving, and changing KSP's planets, moons, etc. to match our own.

Thanks to asmi for kicking me into to doing this and offering so much help along the way; to ferram for aeronautics and orbital help (and FAR, which is essential), and for countless time spent helping others get the most from this mod (and me the most from my modding); to ZRM for many ideas and info; to yargnit and MedievalNerd for playtesting extraordinaire; to everyone else who offered suggestions, code, help, cool screenshots...

===========================
Changelog
v6.3  \/
*ScaledSpace scaling workaround until EVE and Kethane (and anything else that assumes scale) get fixed.
*regex: support changing orbitColor in Orbit nodes (as standard float RGBA color).

v6.2  \/
*PQS->ScaledSpace wrapping now works and caches correctly. Wrap now defaults to false for backwards compatibility. RSS will export obj files (with extra lines using keyword t for vertex tangents) for all wrapped meshes, and import them (if they exist) instead of wrapping. NOTE: If you change any PQS settings (let alone changing RSS configs!) you MUST delete all .obj files in GameData/RealSolarSystem/PluginData! NOTE 2: If you don't already have cached meshes, and/or you delete them all, KSP WILL APPEAR TO HANG on the "Loading..." screen right before Main Menu. This is NORMAL. Let it run. It takes me about 15 minutes. After that, you'll get your usual load times.
*regex: fixed Space Center initial camera height (for when camera is under terrain)
*tons of launch sites from eggrobin!
*regex: fixes for KSCSwitcher; new icon; now saves and loads selected KSC location with your persistence file; shows descriptions; icons hidden on zoomout; can click to set map to focus on selected location.
*Update to ModuleManager 2.1.5
*tweaked Earth's horizon glow a bit

v6.1  \/
*Fixed only changing things if radius differs
*Fixed to work on non-Windows platforms (regex)
*Fixed many atmosphere and temperature curves (eggrobin)
*Fixed misc typos
*Added Moon retexture from SpacedInvader
*Added bodyName support
*Parsing changes, using stupid_chris's ConfigNodeExtensions
*Added KSCSwitcher from regex: can switch KSC to other presets in the Tracking Station
*Added many, many launch site configurations (compiled by eggrobin from the work by Captain Party, ferram, and others)
*Added new descriptions to all Celestial Bodies, thanks to TheKosmonaut/SpaceAnt
*Speedup in timewarpchecker from swamp_ig
*Added support for PQS->scaledspace wrapping (for real this time; didn't work before).
*Added support for replacing scaledspace meshes with spheres (use this for now, importing is broken)
*Added support for compressing normals (defaults to true)

v6    \/
*Changed Kerbin's heightmap, textures, and PQSMods to resemble Earth (allow replacing heightmaps, SS diffuse, and SS normal maps)
*PQSCity and MapDecalTangent can be positioned by latitude/longitude
*Modify scaledspace meshes based on PQS terrain automatically on game load
*Add many new PQSMod settings and limited add/remove support.
*Fixed orbit lines (thanks HoneyFox!)
*Added pressureCurve support with curves for Earth, Venus, and Mars (megathanks Starwaster!)
*Added temperatureCurve support (nothing here yet)
*Fixed a typo with tidally locked orbits (thanks eggrobin!)
*Converted orbits to Earth-relative inclination, to support axial tilt (megathanks eggrobbin!)
*Recompiled for .23.5

v5.6  \/
*Fixed wavelenght color parsing to take four arguments (colors are RGBA after all)
*Added compatibility patches for VisualEnhancements and (thanks, jrandom!) SCANSat
 
v5.5  \/
*Fixed for KSP 0.23

v5.4  \/
*Solar panels finally fixed (really!) thanks to StarWaster.
*Fixed atmo editor keychange

v5.3  \/
*Changed atmo editor to ALT-G
*Fixed Mean Anomaly to be Mean Anomaly at Epoch, fixed handling of it to actually work
*Added new root-of-config property Epoch, for setting starting date. Now, KSP year 0 is 1950.
*Support enabling/disabling atmosphere
*Used metaphor's planet config changes
*Added ability to change science parameters for all bodies (includes config by Medieval Nerd)
*Fixed SOI not respecting minimums

v5.2  \/
*Fixed Titan's atmosphere
*Fixed solar panels (I hope)
*Added configurable atmospheres per Starwaster's work.

v5.1  \/
*Fixed bug where scaledspace meshes were being faded too early (now missing planets appear)
*Fixed Duna's atmosphere end height in the info box.

v5 -- \/
*Every KSP body is now a proxy for a body in the real solar system. However, only the terrains of Kerbin and Mun are edited; the others are merely rescaled.
*Added configurable timewarp. By default 5 and 50 are removed and instead 1 million x and 6m x are added on at the end.
*Edited terrain generator for Kerbin and Mun.
*More support for parameters in the config file.
*Using Majiir's KSPAddonFixed.
*Moved KSC to be nearer the shore.

v4 -- \/
*Switched to new config file system
*Fixed max zoomout on map camera
*Fixed some scaledspace issues
*Changed VAB/SPH camera for more freedom (with a fix: thanks, asmi!)
*Removed 5x and 50x timewarp; added 1 million x and 10m ex timewarp.
*Adjusted solar panels to inverse-square law

v3 -- \/
*Automatically multiplies distances in solar panels' powerCurves by 11 so that they yield rated charge.
*Fixed Kerbin's SMA

v2.1 -- \/
*Went back to scaling Mun's scaledspace transform for now
*Fixed Mun's inclination to avg vs. Earth's equator (since we can't tilt Kerbin's rot axis, we tilt what orbits it)

v2 -- \/
*Added asmi's fix to get KSC, KSC2, and Island land to show up
*Fixed Minmus period, changed Minmus inclination and made it like a captured rock.
*No longer changing Mun's scaledspace representation (it defaults to 0 anyway).

v1 -- \/
*First stable release.
