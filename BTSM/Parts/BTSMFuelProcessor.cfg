	description = What's better than wet, slippery, high explosive, and oh so entertainingly glorious rocket fuel?  Why, all the rocket fuel you could ever want wherever you may want it of course!  Super high tech, super sciency, and super cool, the Fuel Processing Unit is able to convert just about any raw material into both Fuel and Oxidizer when provided with enough energy to sustain the process.  Raw materials can either be collected directly by the unit on the surface of any celestial body, or, in theory, from any celestial body with an atmosphere while in low orbit, when used in combination with an Air Scoop.  Air Scoops and matches sold separately.
