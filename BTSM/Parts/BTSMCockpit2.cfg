	description = After our experiments with historical relics proved less than successful, we decided that perhaps designing our own cockpits using modern technology might be a better approach. We even painted the bottom black to make it look more high-tech! WARNING: This cockpit is pressurized (we figured that bit out), and thus can be used at higher altitudes than the previous model, but exposing it to vacuum may have undesirable results.
