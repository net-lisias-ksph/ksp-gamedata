	description = Screaming at uncaring (albeit quite handsome) gods that they could be so cruel as to not allow rocket fuel to magically teleport from one location to another?  We at FLOOYD Dynamics have come up with the solution to your woes through this electric fuel pump, that when activatived will move both Fuel and Oxidizer to connected parts of your vessel.  Please direct your attention to the stylish arrows painted on the side that indicate the direction in which fuel will flow, and keep in mind that only parts accessible via crossfeed will be processed by this system.  WARNING: FLOOYD Dynamics is in no way liable for any explosive events that may or may not occur should you pump fuel to or from tanks connected to engines in operation.
