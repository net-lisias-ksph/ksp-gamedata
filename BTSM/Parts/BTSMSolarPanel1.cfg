	description = Big, heavy, ineffecient, and extremely fragile these prototype solar panels represent a huge step forward for our space program regardless in providing missions within the inner solar system with a renewable source of energy.  These are probably best used with small probes with minimal energy requirements, but are likely exactly what we needed in order to start exploring other planets.
