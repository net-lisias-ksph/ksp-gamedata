	description = Kerbalkind long ago learned to put violence behind us and resolve our differences through vigorous games of badminton, thus such technology is part of a past we would all rather forget. However, now that we've taken up sticking stuff to rockets, why don't we "borrow" one of these from the museum and see what happens?  WARNING: This cockpit is not 'pressurized' (we're trying to figure out what that word actually means), thus flying at extreme altitudes may void the warranty on any contained Kerbals.
