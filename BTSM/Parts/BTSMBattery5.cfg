	description = The POT-360 Core has been designed for energy fans on a budget that still want all the prestige associated with telling their friends they own a POT-360, without wanting to actually do much with it.  Additional external storage is sold separately at an inflated price for when you realize you actually needed it a few hours after purchase.  No refunds.
