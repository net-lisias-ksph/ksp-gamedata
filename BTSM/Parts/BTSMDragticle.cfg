	description = Having problems with reentry modules tumbling in atmosphere?  Feel like the Kerbal gods are having a good laugh at your expense by imposing arbitrary physical laws that make absolutely no sense?  Then the Amazing Dragticle is for you!  Attach a few of these to the tail end of just about anything, and it will magically keep its orientation!  Order yours and extend a middle digit to those mischievious deities today!  WARNING:  We are in no way responsible if actually extending said middle digit results in being struck by lightning.  Also, attaching too many of these to a rocket may induce excessive drag and negatively impact performance.  Use only in moderation and under adult supervision.
