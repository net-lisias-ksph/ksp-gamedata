	description = Revisiting and expanding upon the XM-G50 Radial Air Intake we've created the L.D.S.D.- A.P.M.U (Low Density Suction Device and Personal Massage Unit): a MUCH larger air-scoop specifically designed to operate just outside of what is conventionally considered to be atmosphere, and collect the trace amounts of material that can be found there.  When attached *directly* to a processing unit, this will allow the unit to continue to operate in a low orbit, which in turn is much more convenient and cost effective than having to ferry resources to and from the surface.  Note that multiple Air Scoops may be required in order to operate a processing unit at maximum capacity, that a celestial body MUST have an atmosphere in order for this unit to operate around it, and that output will decline rapidly as you move further out from the atmosphere due to lower particle density.
