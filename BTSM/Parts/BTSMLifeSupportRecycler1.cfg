	description = While experimenting with various options for sustaining life support on extended missions to Minmus and beyond, we came up with this module which will recycle a good portion of life support making it last much much longer.  Just please don't ask what it is you're drinking. **WARNING**: This part must be attached *directly* to the command module that's consuming life support to have any effect, and will consume a great deal of power while in operation.  It's also worth noting that multiple units will not amplify the effect, as resources may only be recycled once.
