	description = Ever been having so much fun out in the cosmos that you wished you could just stay out there forever?  Have a troublesome ex-wife that makes you wish you lived on another planet?  Well now you can!  The Life Support Processing unit is capable of converting just about any raw material into breathable, drinkable, edible, and conveniently stackable life support!  When landed on the surface of any celestial body it's capable of directly gathering raw materials for processing, or, if the boys over at the aerospace division are to believed, this thing should also be capable of processing the resources gathered with an Air Scoop while in low orbit.  We're not sure if we trust that last part, but whatever...this thing is hela-cool!
