	description = We recently had a rather interesting idea: what if we were to turn our crew themselves into soft gooey experiments?!  The Biometric Sensor Array will take detailed readings on the state of your crew as they travel about the cosmos, providing us with valuable data regarding the effect of exposure to various environments on the health and well being of your (slightly below) average Kerbal.
