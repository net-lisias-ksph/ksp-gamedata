	description = With the revolutionary POT-360 further advances have allowed us to combine several single cells into this lightweight package, increasing storage capacity while drastically decreasing the weight ratio.  Any fears about the high return rate on these units should dissipate in the face of our generous exchange policy.  Note: exchange policy not applicable in space.
