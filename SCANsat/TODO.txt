BEFORE NEXT BUILD:

- I would suggest adding something about the effective orbital range of each part to their description though. (DMagic)
- options for color of text (DMagic)
- show exit symbol on ground track for active orbit

DAY/NIGHT DETECTION:
- make anomaly detection use an optical sensor that only works during day
- showing the day / night terminator like on some of the world clocks (drtedastro)
- pre-requisite for visual band scanner

BIG MAP:
- the removal of the auto-render of the big map when you stop resizing it, reduces the jiggle-lag time if you just want to temp narrow it a bit for example (Thourion)
- a Marker addition from the big map for custom points with a small note. (Thourion)
	- make somehow usable as target?
	
OTHER (NEW OR EXISTING) SCANNERS:
- Maybe use Figaro if installed? (OrtwinS)
- Kethane data on map? (brienne) (should not be handled by SCANsat itself)
- SSTV receiver (KhaosCorp)  (should probably be a separate mod...)
- visible band scanner for pretty pictures (Nertea) 
   - planet texture overlaid with greyscale elevation map?
   - should only work when the area is receiving sunlight?
- api for other mods to hook SCANsat up with data
- RWR (Radar warning receiver) .. The "map" could look like that real RWR: http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/fc/Rwr_example.gif (Nostromo)

SCIENCE AND SUCH:
- science value scanner (show biome map by amount of remaining science)
- science based on how often the satellite setup can update data?
- science for detected anomalies etc. (BananaDealer)

ANOMALIES:
- add more anomalies, e.g. "highest elevation"
- Can we get a table/list of detected anomalies? That would be excellent, even if it's only from a text file in the data directory. (Free Trader Beowulf)
- A few things I would like to see is the anomalies and other markers on the small map and the zoomed in pop up window available from the small map as well. (DwellerBenthos)

TOOLBAR:
- Position limits for UI elements, so that the icon never leaves the screen, and maps (big&small) always have a piece of their title-bar in reach (mind the KSP UI itself!).


MINE:

- detect strongly localized biomes and indicate on map (e.g. craters, badlands)
- cache bigmap height values?
- zoom box should only work if the area can be seen from a relevant sensor in orbit
- optionally display ground track for moons that have an active sensor in orbit?
- kill time warp at critical altitudes if altimetry sensor on board, OR within view of enough satellites
- zoom box wonky at poles (ground track)
- find that one exception that must be printed somewhere (might not be SCANsat after all...)


OTHERS:
- I cant get the instrument window to show up anymore, debug log doesnt mention anything out of order, i just click the button but no dice. I tried with many already flying ships, along with new ones. (Thourion)
- overlaying the planets in the stock map view with your generated images, showing them as a solid colour if they haven't been mapped? (pizzaoverhead)
- Would be nice one day to be able to zoom in on a particular grid and have a small 3d window preview that you can rotate around to get a real sense of a place to land (sirkut)
- configurable raw data export (drtedastro) http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/55832-PLUGIN-PARTS-WIP-SCANsat-terrain-mapping?p=746489&viewfull=1#post746489
- I know that it's common in flight sims to have some kind of mapping app that takes data output from the sim to plot your location, like a GPS map. (DMagic)
- Is there a way to adjust the "sea level". My wife likes a pink Mun, but I'd like to tone it down a bit. (DarthJazno)


- Are you sure button for Forget Map (Geschosskopf)
- an "inverted" display of sorts? Not as in inverted colors, but a map that greys out mapped areas while making non-mapped areas some other (preferably bright) color. (Hremsfeld)
