This update is by NathanKell.
ialdabaoth (who is awesome) created Deadly Reentry 2, based on r4m0n's Deadly Reentry, and I'm maintaining it in ialdabaoth's absence.

License remains CC-BY-SA as modified by ialdabaoth.
Also included: Module Manager (by sarbian, based on ialdabaoth's work). See Module Manager thread for details and license and source: http://http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/55219
Module Manager is required for DREC to work.

A note on settings:
1. Playing on Stock Kerbin, want traditional DRE level of heating: don't change anything
2. Playing on Stock Kerbin, want realistic levels of heat on reentry (i.e. faking an 8km/sec reentry): set the shockwave exponent and multiplier to taste; I suggest exponent 1.12 to start. You will need heat shields built for RSS.
3. Playing on Real-scale Kerbin (Real Solar System), want realistic heating: don't change anything. Use RSS class heat shields.
4. Playing RSS, want traditional DRE level of heating: set _heat_ multiplier to 12 or so.

You can get heatshields configured for RSS, and much more, in the Realism Overhaul release thread.

INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS:
1. If you currently have Deadly Reentry installed, go to KSP/GameData/DeadlyReentry and delete everything (files and folders) except custom.cfg. Also delete any old versions of ModuleManager (modulemanager.dll for example) in your KSP/GameData folder. If you already have ModuleManager1.5.dll or a more recent version that that, keep it, and do not extract the one in this archive.
2. Extract this archive to your KSP/GameData folder (per above, do not extract Module Manager if you already have 1.5+)

USAGE INSTRUCTIONS:
Be careful how you reenter. Make sure your craft has a heatshield (the Mk1 pod has a built-in heatshield, as do stock spaceplanes; the Mk1-2 needs a heat shield from the Structural tab). For a low Kerbin orbit reentry, try for a periapsis of about 20km.

Hold down ALT+D+R to enable debugging. This lets you change settings in-game, and shows additional information when you right-click parts. After making any changes, hit save to write to custom.cfg. Hold ALT+D+R to make the window go away and disable debugging.

==========
Changelog:
v4.7 \/
*Fixed heatshield floatcurves not having tangents (got some unexpected behavior).
*Fix for overriding a part's g tolerance not working
*Upgrade to ModuleManager v2.1.0

v4.61= \/
*Fixed 6.25m heatshield animation modules (thanks Sage!)
*Fixed typos in decouplers (thanks DispleasedScottie!)


v4.6 = \/
*Made AblativeShielding tweakable.
*Added fix from HoneyFox to detect shielded parts the way FAR does
*Added version checking (per Majiir's template)
*Recompiled for 0.23.5

v4.5 = \/
*Fixed compatibility with RealChutes (thanks Starwaster!)
*Attempted just-in-case fix for HotRockets, etc.

v4.4 = \/
*Removed redundant Awake() code - thanks a.g.!

v4.3 = \/
*(Engine) overheating bug fixed thanks to FlowerChild

v4.2 = \/
*Updated cfgs to support new lab (note: Rapier handled automatically)
*Now supports RealChutes
*Speed increase by a.g.
*Now should properly rescale engine heat when engine maxTemp changed (for ModuleEngineFX too)

v4.1 = \/
*0.23 compatibility by taniwha and arsenic87
*maxTemp no longer changed if ModuleHeatshield is present. This should allow thermal sink-style heatshields, when combined with high reflectivity.

v4 === \/
*Removed :Final from custom.cfg
*Moved tech defines to part cfgs
*Added decouplers, used Sentmassen's new texture.
*Fixed explode-on-launch/switch bug
*Added possibility to manually set G Tolerance (Add a ModuleAeroReentry, with the key gTolerance = x , to your part cfg)
*Fixed volume to use Ship volume setting.

v3 === \/
*Added two more tweakable variables: shockwaveExponent and shockwaveMultiplier. shockwaveExponent is applied to shockwave temperature after it's calculated; then the temperature is multiplied by shockwaveMultiplier. To simulate Earth-level heating, use shockwaveExponent = 1.17 (can't be perfect, but it's close: you get a max shockwave temperature of ~6150C on reentry, a bit low; and 11800C on Munar reentry, a bit higher than Apollo 10).

v2.1 = \/
*Forgot to include the tech file and the 0.625 heatshield. Fixed.

v2 === \/
*Added tech nodes for parts. Thanks, Specialist290!
*Upped prelaunch disabling to 2 seconds.
*Added crew death on over-G. Kerbals have human-like G-force tolerance, which means they can survive 5Gs for about 16 minutes, 10 Gs for 1 minute, 20Gs for 3.75 seconds, and 30+ Gs for less than three quarters of a second. The tracker is reset when G load < 5. All these are tweakable in the cfg or in the ingame debug menu. It's done by tracking cumulative Gs. The formula is for each timestep, tracker = tracker + G^crewGPower * timestep (where ^ = power). G is clamped to range [0, crewGClamp]. When tracker > crewGWarn, a warning is displayed. When tracker > crewGLimit, then each frame, per part, generate a random number 0-1, and if > crewGKillChance, a kerbal dies in that part. If G < crewGMin, tracker is reset to 0.

v1 === \/
*Disabled during the first second of prelaunch to fix explode/overheat on launch bug
*added gToleranceMult to tweak the g limits of parts. Works as a global scalar. Currently set to 2.5
