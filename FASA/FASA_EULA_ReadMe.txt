I try extremely hard to make this mod as compatible and bug free as possible but I can not guarantee that it will work flawlessly in every situation and on every system.
This just releases my liability in those situations, and keeps me from getting taken to court over a free mod someone downloaded with a link I have no control over.

By downloading FASA or any piece of software you understand that you are taking a risk of permanent damage to the system or device it is downloaded to, or installed on. Installing or downloading any software may have unintended or undesirable effects to the system or device it is downloaded to or installed on, and I the developer of this software can in no way guarantee that something will not go horribly wrong when using this software.
You, the user of the FASA mod takes full responsibility for any damage, real or simulated that may happen to any system or device it is downloaded to or installed on. Also by using this software you release anyone else from any liability for any damages, forever.
