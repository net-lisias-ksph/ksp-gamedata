description = The Inline Clamp-O-Tron was an accidental invention, created after an engineer (who really should have been wearing his glasses) incorrectly interpreted the Shielded Clamp-O-Tron's blueprints. Still, the rest of the team very much liked the idea of a sideways-pointing docking port with its own aerodynamic shell, so he patented the design. He still refuses to admit it wasn't intentional.
